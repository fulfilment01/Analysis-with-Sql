-- after a long scrutiny of the dataset i was able to see that ARKANSAS has a very low profit due to the unit cost of each product
-- based on this i will advise the complany to close production in this location
-- CALIFONIA is yielding the highest profit based on the sales_table_based_on_location

-- from the dataset i was able to know the team with the highest profit, teams that are performing and teams that are underperforming
-- the best location and the location with less yield and the months where we earned the most

-- after proper analysis i will like to recomend that all the sales teams should kept cause the difference in their output is close
-- and the stores in ARKANSAS should be closed based on the low yeld 
-- from the product category the spoting category should be drop cause of the profit is too small based on the unit cost of each 
-- product bought
